                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years Gavin Adlington has developed a unique breadth of
                            knowledge and a deep understanding of all matters relating to land registration and cadastre
                            systems, especially with regard to the successful implementation of projects involving mass
                            systematic registration of title and the establishment of institutions that can successfully
                            manage real estate registration and cadastres.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">His early years included operational experience as a cadastral
                            surveyor, the implementation of major programs for systematic registration and work as a
                            Registrar in a Title Office and as the Adjudicator in a systematic registration of title
                            program. From the early 1990's to the present day he has been advising various governments
                            around the World on their programs for implementing such projects.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">He has worked in 46 countries on projects in this sector and
                            visited
                            another 20 in order to assess their operations. Gavin sees himself as primarily a practical
                            implementation person, rather than as an author, but decided it was time to document the
                            experiences and lessons learned over a 40+ year career.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the projects that Gavin advised on or led were in the
                            Eastern
                            Europe and Central Asia region where major reforms were being implemented following the
                            collapse
                            of the socialist systems and change over to market economies in the early 1990's, but he
                            covered
                            many countries in other regions as well. He has worked primarily for the World Bank through
                            the
                            last 20+ years of his career, eventually becoming the global lead specialist for land and
                            geospatial matters worldwide for the World Bank. He retired in 2015 but has since then
                            continued
                            to work as a consultant in the same sector.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In December 2013, Gavin received the Michael Barrett Award from
                            the
                            Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of the United Kingdom “to the person whom in the
                            opinion of the panel/ division has contributed most to the understanding of the subjects of
                            land
                            transfer, registration and administration, encroachments, cadastre and boundary issues, or

                            award

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Following specialisation in property law at university, Tony began
                            work
                            as a legal officer at the New South Wales, Australia Land Titles in 1989 and was engaged in
                            document registration, property litigation, drafting of new laws and regulations, and
                            providing
                            education and advice to the public and professions.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">During that time, he completed a masters degree in dispute
                            resolution
                            and instituted a program for resolving contentious cases, including in relation to boundary
                            disputes. In 1995, while still with the Land Titles Office, Tony began providing technical
                            assistance, first in Laos and then a series of other countries. Since then, he has worked in
                            over 30 countries worldwide, having left the government in 2005 to concentrate on
                            consulting.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">His work in Laos in the late 1990s formed the basis of a Master of
                            Laws
                            degree, for which he won the university medal. His work with the World Bank, UN FAO and
                            other
                            organisations over the years has formed the basis for a variety of publications, several of
                            which are cited in this book. He also co-authored the zero version of the Voluntary
                            Guidelines
